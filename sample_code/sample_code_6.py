CONCEPT: GIVING THE CHATBOT INSTRUCTIONS

So far, the chatbot can answer questions, but it does not have a specific role.

We can give the model instructions that describe:
1. who the chatbot should act like
2. how it should respond
3. what rules or boundaries it should follow

Your job:
Change the INSTRUCTIONS so your chatbot has its own persona.

Your instructions should include:
- a purpose
- an audience
- a tone
- at least one boundary

Then test your chatbot and see how its responses change.
