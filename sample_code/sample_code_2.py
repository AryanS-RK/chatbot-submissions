CONCEPT: MAKING YOUR FIRST API REQUEST

This program sends one request to an AI model and prints the response.

The API request needs:
1. A model — which AI model should answer.
2. An input — what we want to ask the model.

Your job:
Replace "insert-model-name" with the model we are using in class.
