CONCEPT: RESETTING THE CONVERSATION

Our chatbot now remembers earlier messages by storing the ID of the
previous response.

A reset should make the chatbot forget that conversation and start fresh.

Your job:
When the user types "reset":

1. remove the saved conversation state
2. print a short reset message
3. skip the API call for that turn

Hint:
What value did previous_response_id have before the conversation started?
