CONCEPT: MAKING THE CHATBOT REPEAT

Right now, the program can only handle one message at a time.
After it prints the bot's response, the program ends.

A chatbot should keep asking the user for new messages until
the user chooses to stop.

Your job:
Add a loop so the program repeatedly:
1. asks the user for a message
2. sends that message to the model
3. prints the model's response
